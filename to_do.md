# First Steps
1. Start a read only connection to a pgdb (no mutations allowd)
2. Print a serde_json object to stdout
3. Pretty print that json
4. execute a query and investigate the return types
5. figure out how to turn that return into arbitrary json

# Long Term
1. read options from flags
2. read options from a toml file, over-ridden by flags
3. save connections to the config file
4. global config? or is that not going to work in rust
